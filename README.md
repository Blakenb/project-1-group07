# Breathe Easy: Your Daily Wellness Companion

## Description

It can be challenging to maintain a balance between necessary duties and self-nurturing. The Breathe Easy application was created to help users map out their day while prioritizing their mental health. With Breathe Easy, users can track their daily tasks, log their moods, and practice mindfulness strategies. The data gathered will help the user spot trends and correlations between moods and tasks.

Remember to breathe easy and organize your day.
